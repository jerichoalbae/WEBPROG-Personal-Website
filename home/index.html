                    <p>My hobbies and interests are diverse and constantly evolving. I enjoy playing volleyball, which allows me to stay active and connect with others in a team environment. I also love dancing during my free time, which helps me express myself creatively and stay fit. Spending quality time with family and friends is essential to me, as it strengthens relationships and brings joy. Additionally, I value my "me time," where I can unwind, reflect, and recharge for the challenges ahead.</p>
